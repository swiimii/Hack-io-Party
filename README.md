# Inspiration

Hack-io Party is a minigame collection inspired by Mario Party and Wario Ware, where you try and beat as many minigames as possible, and try to reach a high score!

As a team with both Electrical Engineering and Computer Engineering / Science majors, we wanted to make a project that allowed all of us to fully participate and learn new skills relevant to our majors. By both creating a Unity game, and creating a breadboard controller for it, we were able to learn about how our disciplines can be combined to make an awesome project!

# What it does

The Hack-io Party Game is a series of mini-games in which you try to beat as many games in a row as possible.

The Hack-io'd Controller is an Arduino device which sends user input (inputted via button or motion sensor) over a serial connection. This signal is detected in Hack-io Party, and used to trigger game events.

# How we built it
Software

We created our game using Unity 2020.3.30f1, and created our Arduino binaries using the Arduino IDE.
Hardware

We created our controller using an Arduino Uno, a Breadboard, Buttons, and a Motion Sensor.

We also prepared a and tested Water Temperature sensor and Humidity, however these were not included in the final device implementation.
